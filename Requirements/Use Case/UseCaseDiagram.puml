note right of User
The User is the primary actor and represents a fan or analyst who interacts with the system to explore F1 race data. The user chooses a race session, selects up to two drivers, and views multiple charts to understand performance and strategy in a simple, visual way.
end note

note left of DataSrc
The FastF1 Data Source is a secondary actor representing the external data provider/library used to fetch race session data. The system depends on it to retrieve lap times, positions, and stint information needed to generate the analysis views.
end note

note bottom of UC1
This use case allows the user to choose the season, race, and session to analyze. After selection, the system loads the session data so that all other analysis views can be generated for the chosen context.
end note

note bottom of UC2
This use case allows the user to select up to two drivers for comparison. The system stores the selected drivers so the same driver choices are used consistently across the different charts.
end note

note bottom of UC3
This use case displays a lap time comparison for the selected drivers in the chosen session. It helps the user understand pace differences across laps through a clear visual comparison.
end note

note bottom of UC4
This use case shows how the selected drivers’ positions change across laps. It helps the user see overtakes and position gains/losses during the session.
end note

note bottom of UC5
This use case displays tyre stints for the selected drivers, including compounds and pit-stop timing. It helps the user understand basic strategy choices during the session.
end note
